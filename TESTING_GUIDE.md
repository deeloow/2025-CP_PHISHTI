```
Device: Pixel 6 Pro
API Level: 34 (Android 14)
RAM: 8GB
Storage: 128GB
Screen: 6.7" 1440x3120
```

### 2. Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests
flutter test --coverage
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart

# Memory profiling
flutter run --profile
```

## Real Device Testing

5. **Screenshots/Logs**: Visual evidence and error logs
6. **Frequency**: How often the issue occurs

## Continuous Testing

### 1. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Compatibility Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - run: flutter test
      - run: flutter build apk --release
```

### 2. Regular Testing Schedule
- **Daily**: Automated tests on emulators
- **Weekly**: Manual testing on real devices
- **Monthly**: Full compatibility testing
- **Before Release**: Comprehensive testing

This testing approach ensures your app works reliably across all smartphone devices and provides the best possible user experience.
